# Windlogger - Backend

This is the backend for [windlogger.se](http://windlogger.se), a wind data aggregator. Windlogger collects and presents wind speed data from 200+ weather stations in Sweden.

The [Windlogger - Frontend](https://github.com/jonkr/windlogger-frontend) repo has a thicker README, for now. It also contains general info about the app and the stack in use.
